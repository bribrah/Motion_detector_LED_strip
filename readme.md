# LED Strip Motion Detector Project
* This is for an LED strip that goes under the bed that should detect movement and turn on when movement is detected
* Use of 2 motion sensors placed in different orientations to detect movemt
* Use of potentiometer to control light brightness
* Use of FREERTOS in order to run serial interface and light in tandem
* Use of serial interface to set light color
## TODO
* Implement photoresistor for mesauring if the room is already bright
* Implement wifi module or IR remote to control color without needing to plug in serial interface
